/*
this was a harder one to complete this time around, I tackled writing these for a while before
having to look at the solutions. Once I saw the solution it all made sense. Unsure if it was the wording of the task...

After doing the course quiz, functions is something I'm going to need to do more of. 
It's clear that I don't have a full grasp of the concepts, with only scoring 7 out of 10.
